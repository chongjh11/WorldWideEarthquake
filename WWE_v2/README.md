This folder (WWE_v2) consist of v2.0 and v2.1. Both requires the same THREE main folders (m_map, etopo1_ice_g_i2 , and borders) to operate.

Ensure that the WWE_v2 folder includes all THREE of the listed folders.
There is only 'borders' and 'm_map' in this directory. You will need to download 'etopo1_ice_g_i2'.
